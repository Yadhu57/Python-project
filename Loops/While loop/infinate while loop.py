while 2:
    print("Hi! we are inside the infinite while loop")
# # If the condition is given in the while loop never becomes false, then the while loop will never
# terminate, and it turns into the infinite while loop.
# Any non-zero value in the while loop indicates an always-true condition, whereas zero
# indicates the always-false condition. This type of approach is useful if we want our program
# to run continuously in the loop without any disturbance.
